                        <h1>About me</h1>
                        <p>I'm Anushka Agrawal, a detail-oriented and design-driven professional transitioning from the field of architecture to UI/UX design. My journey began with over four years of experience in architectural design, where I specialized in creating functional yet aesthetically pleasing spaces. During this time, I honed skills in spatial planning, problem-solving, and user-focused design thinking, skills that go beyond physical spaces and translate seamlessly into digital interfaces.</p>
                        
                        <p>What excites me most about UX design is the opportunity to combine creativity with empathy to solve real-world problems. Earning the Google UX Design Professional Certificate allowed me to formalize my skills in user research, wireframing, prototyping, and usability testing. I enjoy diving deep into understanding user needs, mapping out journeys, and designing intuitive solutions that make digital products not only usable but enjoyable.</p>
                        
                        <p>My background in architecture gives me a unique lens, where I naturally think about balance, structure, and human interaction with environments. Just as in architecture, where every corner and pathway influences how people move through a space, in UX, every screen and micro-interaction shapes how users experience a product. This multidisciplinary perspective helps me approach challenges with both analytical rigor and creative sensitivity.</p>
                        
                        <p>Currently based in Pune, I am actively seeking opportunities in UI/UX design where I can bring together my diverse experiences to craft digital experiences that are thoughtful, impactful, and user-centered. My goal is to design products that not only meet functional needs but also resonate with users on an emotional level, because great design, whether physical or digital, is about how it makes people feel.</p>
